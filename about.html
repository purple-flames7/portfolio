        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I’m Katia.</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a <span class="highlight">web developer</span>, creative thinker,
          and lifelong learner. I started learning web development to open up
          more opportunities for myself and others — and I’ve fallen in love
          with the power of turning ideas into interactive, inclusive digital
          experiences.

        <h2 class="section-title">Why I Build Websites</h2>
        <p>
          For me, code is creative. I love that you can start with nothing —
          just an idea — and build something beautiful, functional, and alive.
          Every project is a space to express myself, solve real problems, and
          design something that works for people.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What I Care About</h2>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about sustainability, inclusivity, and community. I
          believe tech should serve people — all people — and I want to build
          with intention. I’m especially inspired by projects that align with
          the <span class="highlight">Sustainable Development Goals</span>,
          champion marginalized voices, and expand access.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a proud queer African woman, I’m always thinking about how we
          create digital spaces that are welcoming, joyful, and empowering. That
          energy fuels my work.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">A Little More About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a quiet nerd with a big heart and a sharp sense of humor. I love
          good design, messy sketchbooks, great music, and big ideas. My friends
          joke that I can do anything — and I take that as a challenge.
